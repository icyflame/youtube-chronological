# Chronological Playlists for Channels

> Create a playlist of the videos uploaded by a channel in chronological order


## How?

_Warning:_ Using this script is not easy or intuitive. I apologise for that. I planned
to put this up as a Web application, but building that was cumbersome so I
didn't do it. If you want to take it up, please feel free to submit a patch!

In any case, I will put the instructions to run this script: (These are for a
future-me as much as for anyone else out there, so if you don't understand a
sentence, please open an issue! we can figure it out together)

## Why?

In the YouTube universe, search is great, CDNs and DevOps is amazing. But
binging on all the videos a channel has uploaded is not great. In fact, it's one
of the most irritating things to do. I have searched for online websites that do
it, browser plugins that will autoplay videos. No luck anywhere.

Considering that the Youtube Data API is well documented, I decided to write
this script.
